### Salesforce Docker
The official Dockerfile for Salesforce DX.

The primary use for this Dockerfile is for [Visual Studio Code Remote Development](https://forcedotcom.github.io/salesforcedx-vscode/articles/user-guide/remote-development), but it can also be used for other things like standardizing the build or continous integration environments.
